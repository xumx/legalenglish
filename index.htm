                                    The Legal-Ease International seminars are courses on the language of the law. Legal English has its own unique set of terminology and idioms. The course is devoted to helping the international attorney, or student feel comfortable when writing, speaking or reading legal documents. The course will help the participant utilize the exact vocabulary word that they need in order to transact business and other legal work in English. One misused word can change the entire meaning of an agreement and so the course is an indispensable tool to learn it. The participants will learn some U.S. law as a basis with which to teach the terminology but it will not be a course on U.S. law, but rather the language of the law.

                                    Yes. Although most of our participants are lawyers we have many students and they always enjoy it very much. It is a good way for them to meet attorneys in their cities as well as a great course to put on their resume. The seminar is also a very good preparation for students planning on continuing their education by going to the U.S. and getting a masters in law.

                            <div class="description" style="width:90%; padding-left: 20px;">
                                <p>
                                    Yes. In our seminars we have had many legal translators. It is a great course for them since their translations are only as good as their skills in Legal English. Usually translators have excellent English but no knowledge of the law. The course will give them a background as well. Many translators have met attorneys in our seminars and have consulted with them after the course. We have also had notary publics, legal secretaries, accountants and other businessmen. Anyone that needs to deal with Legal English can benefit enormously from this course.

                            <div class="description" style="width:90%; padding-left: 20px;">
                                <p>
                                    Many participants have to miss a lesson due to travel plans or some other reason. We are well familiar with that. If the they tell the instructor during class when they are going to be absent we can give them the material in advance so they are sure not to miss anything. They are also free to ask questions after class about what they missed. It will not affect getting a diploma.
                                </p>

                                    All of our instructors are U.S. attorneys with extensive experience teaching these seminars to foreign attorneys all around the world. It is a great opportunity to take this course from a U.S. lawyer who knows the law as well. This is not a course that would be as beneficial if taught by someone who is not a U.S. attorney.
                                </p>

We are always complimented on our materials. The students use them as resources way after the course ends.
